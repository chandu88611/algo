                          Engaging in margin trading of FX, precious metals, and
                          CFDs (i.e., using leverage) isn’t suitable for everyone,
                          as it entails a high risk of loss. You should be fully
                          aware of the risks involved, given that price
                          fluctuations in such instruments can lead to variations
                          in the value of your investment. Any trading or market
                          speculation capable of generating exceptionally high
                          returns on investment also comes with unusually high
                          risks. Significant losses can occur within a short time
                          frame due to market shifts or position accumulation.

                          Before opting to participate in margin trading of FX,
                          precious metals, or CFDs, it’s crucial to thoroughly
                          assess your investment goals, experience level, and risk
                          tolerance. You should only invest the portion of your
                          assets that you are willing and able to lose completely;
                          only surplus funds should be risked. If you do not
                          possess such surplus funds, it is essential to refrain
                          from engaging in margin trading. If you have any
                          uncertainties about the risks associated with margin
                          trading in FX, precious metals, and CFDs, it’s advisable
                          to seek guidance from an independent financial advisor
                          and obtain all necessary information.{" "}
