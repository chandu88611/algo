              Modern society currently faces a serious challenge in preventing
              money laundering, e.g. making the possession, use, or disposal of
              money or other property obtained from criminal activities appear to
              be legal, and terrorism financing - providing or gathering money or
              rendering financial services with the knowledge that the money is
              intended to finance the organization, preparation for, or execution
              of terrorist acts or to support a criminal society (criminal
              organization) created or being created to perform terrorist acts.
              Individuals and legal entities whose income is earned illegally make
              various attempts to legalize their income. For example, they may use
              other people's personal data, including data that has been acquired
              fraudulently. This may become a problem for people who become
              victims of fraud and are uninvolved in these parties' criminal
              activities.

              There is no single stage of money laundering; methods can range from
              the purchase and resale of luxury items such as a car or jewellery
              to passing money through a complex web of legitimate operations.
              Usually, the starting point will be cash, but it is important to
              appreciate that money laundering is defined in terms of criminal
              property. This can be property in any conceivable legal form,
              whether money, rights, real estate or any other benefit; if you know
              or suspect that it was obtained, either directly or indirectly, as a
              result of criminal activity and you do not speak up, then you too
              are taking a part in the process.{" "}

              The money is moved through the system in a series of financial

              When a transaction takes place, the source of funds, i.e. how the

              ascertained and recorded in the client file (this would usually be

                  Where identity is verified electronically, we can apply an
                  additional verification check to manage the risk of
                  impersonation fraud. For example, one of these checks may
                  require a copy of documents to be certified by an appropriate
                  authority.
